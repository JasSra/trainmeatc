# Contributing

1. Fork and branch from `main` (feature/short-desc).
2. Keep changes atomic; update related docs if contracts change.
3. Run formatting (`dotnet format`) and tests before PR.
4. For prompt changes: explain rationale and provide before/after sample.
5. Do not include real API keys or proprietary frequency data in commits.
