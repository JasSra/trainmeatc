# Audio FX Notes (Optional)

For rf_quality=noisy:
- Apply high-pass filter at 300Hz (Q ~0.7) and low-pass at 3kHz
- Inject pink noise at low gain (0.02 to 0.04)
- Optional slight compression (ratio 2:1) to mimic radio dynamics

Ensure intelligibility score (subjective) remains high; avoid over-degradation.
